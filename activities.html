        <p>The programmes as a part of the annual celebrations
            of the school in 2000 was later adopted by the development
            committee & natives and is now known as Kallara- Pangode 
            fest or as “Magical Fest in the historical world”, is a
            famous regional cultural fest. From the last fifteen 
            years after the mid summer exams the one week long
            fest begins with the PTA meetings. Thousands of 
            people including the former students ,natives ,
            parents and students get together for the cultural 
            fest. Programmes of students , parents and other 
            artists are held on the main stage whereas exhibitions 
            ,book fest , agricultural and industrial exhibitions 
            and trade , amusement park,flower show etc are also 
            arranged. We consider the fest as an opportunity to
                reveal the excellency of the school, the artistic
                and cultural skills of the students in front of 
                the public. The school which faced a threat of 
                closure is now excelling with more than 500 
                students in the UP level and survives as an 
                example of the concept that schools and society
                are one and society adopts school.</p></div>
